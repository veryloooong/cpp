# Description

In a park, there are n friends standing in a random order, and they plan to throw a ball around. Each friend has a unique number in the range of 1 to n, inclusive. The i friend will always throw the ball towards the friend given at receiver[i], and this will happen each second. Friend 1 always starts with the ball, and a player always throws to another player. Determine which friend has the ball after k seconds pass.

Note: Friends are numbered starting with 1.

# Example

```
receiver = [2 , 4 , 1 , 5 , 3]

seconds = 6

       Second 	    Has ball	    Receiver
  1		1		2
  2		2		4
  3		4		5
  4		5		3
  5		3		1
  6		1		2
```
After 6 seconds, the ball will be with friend 2.


# Input Constraints

- 2 ≤  n ≤ 2 x 10^5
- 1 ≤ receiver[i] ≤ n (receiver[i]≠ i)
- 1 ≤ seconds ≤ 10^12

## Sample Input For Custom Testing

```
STDIN    Function
-----    --------

2
5        seconds = 5
```

# Output
int: the friend holding the ball at time = seconds
