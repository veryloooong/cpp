# Description

Given a permutation p of length n denoted by p = [p1, p2,…, on], a number k is balanced if there are two indices l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), such that the numbers [p[l], p[l+1],…, p[r]] form a permutation of the numbers 1, 2,…, k.

For each k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), determine if it is a balanced number or not. Return a binary string ans of length n, where the ith character of the string (considering 1-based indexing) is '1' if i is a balanced number and '0' otherwise.

Note: A permutation of length n contains each integer from 1 to n exactly once in any order.

# Example

Consider n = 4, p = [4, 1, 3, 2].

- For k = 1: Choose l = 2 and r = 2, the chosen p[2:2] =  [1], a permutation of length 1.
- For k = 2: No pair of indices results in a permutation of length 2.  It is not a balanced number.
- k = 3: l = 2, r = 4, p[2:4] = [1, 3, 2], a permutation of length 3.
- k = 4, l = 1, r = 4, p[1:4] =  [4, 1, 3, 2], a permutation of length 4.

The balanced numbers are 1, 3, and 4, while 2 is not balanced. The answer is "1011".
