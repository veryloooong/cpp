# Description

Consider an array arr of length n. The the cost of the array is defined as the sum of the number of distinct elements over all prefixes of the array. For example, the cost of [1, 2, 1] is equal to distinct elements in [1] + distinct elements in [1, 2] + distinct elements in [1, 2, 1] = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

Find the minimum cost among all possible permutations of arr.

Note: A permutation is a rearrangement of elements of an array into a new array. For example, there are 24 permutations of array [1, 2, 3, 4]. Some of them are [2, 1, 4, 3], [4, 1, 2, 3] and [1, 4, 2, 3].


# Input

The first line contains an integer, n, the number of elements in arr. Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i < n) contains an integer, arr[i].

## Constraints

- 1≤ n ≤10^5
- 1≤ arr[i] ≤10^5
